# Modifying helpernodectl Behavior

> NOTE: Currently `set` isn't fully functional

The `set` subcommand is used to set configurations in the `~/.helpernodectl.yaml` file.

Example:

```shell
helpernodectl set key=value
```

The `~/.helpernodectl.yaml` sets `helpernodectl` specific configurations,
applicable only to the CLI tool.
